## Shell Variables: A Detailed Tutorial

### Introduction to Shell Variables

Shell variables are used to store data that can be used and manipulated throughout your shell session. Variables are essential in scripting as they allow you to store information, such as user inputs, filenames, or the results of commands.

### Declaring Variables

Variables in shell scripts do not require explicit declaration of their data types. Instead, the shell determines the data type based on the value assigned.

#### Syntax
```sh
variable_name=value
```

#### Examples
```sh
name="John Doe"
age=30
is_student=true
```

### Using Variables

Once a variable is declared, you can use it by prefixing it with a dollar sign `$`.

#### Example
```sh
echo "Name: $name"
echo "Age: $age"
echo "Student: $is_student"
```

### Data Types in Shell

Shell variables can hold different types of data such as strings, integers, and arrays. However, they are all treated as strings by default.

#### String Example
```sh
greeting="Hello, World!"
echo $greeting
```

#### Integer Example
```sh
number=42
echo $number
```

### Special Variables

Shell provides some special variables for handling different aspects of the script execution environment.

- `$0` - The name of the script
- `$1, $2, ..., $N` - Positional parameters for arguments passed to the script
- `$#` - Number of arguments passed to the script
- `$@` - All arguments passed to the script
- `$?` - The exit status of the last executed command
- `$$` - The process ID of the current shell
- `$USER` - The current logged-in username
- `$HOSTNAME` - The name of the host
- `$SECONDS` - The number of seconds since the shell was started

#### Example
```sh
echo "Script Name: $0"
echo "First Argument: $1"
echo "Number of Arguments: $#"
```

### Environment Variables

Environment variables are a type of variable that can affect the behavior of the shell and other processes. They are usually set using the `export` command.

#### Example
```sh
export PATH=$PATH:/new/directory/path
echo $PATH
```

### Variable Operations

You can perform various operations on variables, such as arithmetic operations on integers or string manipulation.

#### Arithmetic Operations

Use the `expr` command or the `$(( ... ))` syntax for arithmetic operations.

##### Example
```sh
num1=10
num2=20
sum=$(expr $num1 + $num2)
echo "Sum: $sum"

# Alternatively
sum=$((num1 + num2))
echo "Sum: $sum"
```

#### String Operations

String operations can include concatenation, finding the length, or extracting substrings.

##### Concatenation Example
```sh
str1="Hello"
str2="World"
result="$str1, $str2!"
echo $result
```

##### Length Example
```sh
str="Hello"
length=${#str}
echo "Length: $length"
```

##### Substring Example
```sh
str="Hello, World!"
substr=${str:7:5}
echo "Substring: $substr"
```

### Arrays

Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable. Each element in an array is accessed using its index.

#### Declaring and Using Arrays

##### Example
```sh
fruits=("Apple" "Banana" "Cherry")
echo "First Fruit: ${fruits[0]}"
echo "All Fruits: ${fruits[@]}"
```

#### Adding Elements to Arrays

You can add elements to an array using the `+=` operator.

##### Example
```sh
fruits+=("Date")
echo "Fruits: ${fruits[@]}"
```

### Practice Examples

#### Example 1: Simple Variable Assignment and Usage

```sh
#!/bin/bash

name="Alice"
age=25

echo "Name: $name"
echo "Age: $age"
```

#### Example 2: Arithmetic Operations

```sh
#!/bin/bash

num1=15
num2=5

sum=$((num1 + num2))
difference=$((num1 - num2))
product=$((num1 * num2))
quotient=$((num1 / num2))

echo "Sum: $sum"
echo "Difference: $difference"
echo "Product: $product"
echo "Quotient: $quotient"
```

#### Example 3: String Manipulation

```sh
#!/bin/bash

greeting="Hello"
name="Bob"
full_greeting="$greeting, $name!"

echo $full_greeting
echo "Length of greeting: ${#greeting}"
echo "Substring: ${greeting:1:3}"
```

#### Example 4: Working with Arrays

```sh
#!/bin/bash

cities=("New York" "Los Angeles" "Chicago")

echo "First City: ${cities[0]}"
echo "All Cities: ${cities[@]}"

cities+=("Houston")
echo "Updated Cities: ${cities[@]}"
```

#### Example 5: Special Variables

```sh
#!/bin/bash

echo "Script Name: $0"
echo "First Argument: $1"
echo "Number of Arguments: $#"
echo "All Arguments: $@"
echo "Exit Status of Last Command: $?"
echo "Process ID: $$"
echo "User: $USER"
echo "Hostname: $HOSTNAME"
echo "Seconds since shell started: $SECONDS"
```

### Conclusion

Understanding shell variables and their operations is fundamental to writing effective shell scripts. By practicing these examples and experimenting with different variable manipulations, you can become proficient in using variables in your shell scripts.
